1. What are the three states of a Promise?
    Pending, Resolved, Rejected
2. How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
    they allow code to stay much more readable and organized.
3. What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?
    then is for resolved promises whereas catch is for failed promises. Use catch to catch errors and then to do work after its been successful.
