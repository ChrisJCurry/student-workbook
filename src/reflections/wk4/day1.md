1. What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?
    Some cuases are people writing code that works from top to bottom visually. This leads to issues of a lot of encasing.
2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
    Asynchronous means to take time.
    Callbacks are involved by using them to not return data instantly.
3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell
    1 - Keep Code Shallow
        - This allows code to stay organized without the reader having to constantly think of where they are/what theyre reading.
    2 - Modularize
        - Make/use libraries to avoid doing more work than necessary.
    3 - Handle Every Single Error
        - Putting errors first makes it for easy remembering of handling errors.
