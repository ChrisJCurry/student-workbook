1. What problem does using exports solve?
    - It allows you to use functions or defaults from other scripts. Useful so you dont have to re-write the code multiple times.
2. How does export differ from export default?
    - Export will export with what is returned, export default will export with the default given in the constructor.
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
    - It allows you to stay organized and saves potentially a good chunk of time by not having to rewrite entire code snippets and being able to just borrow from another.
