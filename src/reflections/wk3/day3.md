1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
    - get and set

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?
    - Add a return to return the value of the object's property
3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
    - It allows us to access the object properties without directly modifying them unless we specifically say to. It allows us to store the variables/objects on another, more secure file and can use the functions to Get/Set the values without ever showing the data.
