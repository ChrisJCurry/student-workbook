1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
    - To hide from the user to limit what they can manipulate and modify in your code. This lets you not have to worry about leaving variables and/or methods vulnerable.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
    - closures didnt have private properties
    - Not everyone knew or accepted the underscore prefix, leaving it an issue to understand/pass information through.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
    by putting them into the scopes theyre used or by setting up factory functions. Either to truly enforce encapsulation or to go with the general coding style.
