```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?

  - It keeps segregation of work as well as gives a small amount of security so the users cant modify anything directly without just doing it by themselves.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
