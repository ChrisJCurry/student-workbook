1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
    -Named function - Can be hoisted
    -Function expressions - Can be used as a smaller function without creating a whole whitespace-filled function
    -Arrow Function Expression - A mix between named and function expression.


2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

    -Parameters - Used when defining a function, it stores a copy of data
    -Arguments - Used when invoking the function. Is the data thats passed to the function.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

    -A higher Order Function is one that has a function in the parameters. Array.filter is one. It makes a new array with the objects that passed the filter test.
