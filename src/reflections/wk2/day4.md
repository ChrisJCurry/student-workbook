1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
    - It allows you to write cleaner, clearer code that isnt inflated with possible bloat since it was created so quickly and without thought.
    - Having a plan lets you focus on the important things for the project rather than adding minute details that wastes time.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
    - I started to learn to use the documents directly. A lot of the times, I can find exactly what I need with relatively close examples to what I'm looking for. However, there are times where the question is a bit specific to which I then use stackoverflow if I still can't figure it out with using the docs.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
    - Don't overthink things, but also don't be lazy. If you're going to learn, make sure to not just copy/paste others' work, make sure you understand each and every line you use. Don't act like you know everything, constantly be learning as a way to expand on yourself.

    Note: I worked with Mike Jones on this. We started off making one single github using my name, and he forked.
