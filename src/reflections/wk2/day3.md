1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
    - You can write functions and/or conditional statements directly or use the console as a way to debug errors.
    - Writing functions/statements are useful to figure out calculations right in the console while working on other issues. It's also good for when you need to write out variables or checking to see if/when variables are updated.

2. What tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
    - The Elements Tag.
    - It's useful when debugging due to being able to directly modify HTML/CSS in real time and seeing exactly what the issue is.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    - The debugger. It acts as a Code editor as well as has a debugging plane. The debugger allows you to use break points which lets you inspect and basically pause the loading of the website until you're ready.
