##What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
As someone who isn't creative or artistic, the simple modifying of text and text color is an easy way to make things look more professional while still being easy to do regarding design.

Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
https://getbootstrap.com/ will be one of the most used resources. It has a lot of features that don't require a lot of complicated work to make things look well done.

How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
It's definitely one of the more important aspects. If the website's design is outdated or unappealing, I feel it will leave a bad taste in their mouth. If you care enough to make it look modern while still being easy to work with, it's a good site.
