1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
    The purpose of wireframing is to keep the concept user-focused, clarify and define website features, and quick/cheap to create. This allows developers and designers to quickly put out concepts to see if the users are engaged and enjoy the concepts.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
    There is low-, mid-, and high-fidelity wireframes.
    - Low- is useful due to how fast its able to be made and modified.
    - Mid- is useful due to it being more accurate without having a lot of fluff, leaving the barebones of the website to be critiqued easier while still being relatively quick.
    - High- is useful due to being more detailed, therefore allows the developers to see exactly how they want their designs to look. Usually in the later stages so it's not wasted time making something early on.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not? 
    I feel they definitely have a use. The low-fidelity are nice due to how quick they can be made/scrapped, whereas the high-fidelity is nice due to being able to see exactly what you had in mind come to life. Mid-fidelity seems to be the least-worth the time simply due to it requiring more work while not being too much more specific than low-fidelity.
