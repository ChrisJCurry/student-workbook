1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
A pseudo-class is a class that happens only in other classes. Like :hover, it will add/remove the features you write inside of the :hover pseudo-class.

 2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
 Specificity is the rank of calls. An example would be having the main{} class have the text color in general as black, but then having a special class to modify the color if its for a special spot in the website. It keeps you organized while having a back-up rank in case something goes wrong.
 
 3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
 It could stop your code from overwriting something, like the color of text or font-size. It also possibly overwrites stylesheets that are loaded, even if theyre loaded after.
